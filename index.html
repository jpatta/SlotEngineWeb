        <h1>Ultra-light. Lightning fast.</h1>
        <p>Each SlotEngine&reg; request/response runs as a highly efficient transaction, through a HA (high availability)
          configuration with NGINX. SlotEngine&reg; has been tuned for a high transaction throughput, in a
          lightning-fast round-the-globe battery of tests, against CloudFront-ed Amazon EC2 and RDS services. </p>
        <p>Clean-state start and a single-thread / single-purpose micro-transaction design, makes for a highly
          efficient, uncluttered operational model, easy to debug, maintain, and scale. Redis-based session and state
          management deliveres maximum game performance efficiency. Review a comparison of <a href="downloads/SlotEngine%20vs%20Legacy.pdf"> SlotEngine vs legacy RGS</a> solutions.</p>

        <h1>Any size. Any model.</h1>
        <p>SlotEngine&reg; was designed for infrastructure implementation that can scale vertically and horizontally,
          to accommodate operations of any size, under any legal model. Distribution, computing, and storage are decoupled, allowing for theoretically limitless operations. The solution may be deployed privately, or, for example,
          under AWS or Google cloud infrastructure. </p>

        <p>SlotEngine&reg; may be deployed for <b>social or simulated</b> games anywhere in the world, immediately.
          <b>Regulated real money</b> gaming jurisdictions require separate approval and certification by the
          jurisdiction's approved labs. SlotEngine&reg; has been certified by GLI against the international <b>GLI-19</b> 
          standards, and by iTechLabs for UK/Malta RNG compliance. SlotEngine&reg; is *regulator-ready.
